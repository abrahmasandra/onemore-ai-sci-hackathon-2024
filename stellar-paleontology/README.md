# Machine learning enhanced stellar paleontology

Observations of compact binary mergers provide rich information about the nature of spacetime, cosmology, and astrophysics.
In this project we will focus on the last of these.
The black holes and neutron stars in compact binary mergers formed as the end state of the evolution of (at least) as pair of massive stars.
By observing these sources we can test our physical models of stellar and binary evolution - a method sometimes referred to as [stellar paleontology](https://www.nature.com/articles/547284a).

There are three separate challenges for this project and teams are welcome to attempts as many or as few of them as possible.
All three challenges use the same dataset, initial stellar binary parameters and final compact binary parameters for 50 million
simulated stellar binaries.

The challenges have their own descriptions in [classification.md](classification.md), [regression.md](regression.md), and [generation.md](generation.md).
Additionally example scripts are provided for the first two challenges showing how to load the data and evaluate the task using very simple models.

The data is taken from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/6346444) and preprocessed to remove extraneous fields.
